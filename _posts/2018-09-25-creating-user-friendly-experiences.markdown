Nowadays user friendliness is a must have. In everything we use, we expect to be delighted, to find and use what we need easily.

This session will be about helping you craft a User Experience (UX) toolset dedicated to your needs and constraints. Showing practical examples and tools as well as return on experiences. We will start by expliciting what UX is then quickly dive deeper in the process and the various  tools  you can use with high return on investment.

Building great products is not straightforward, a broad range of skills and tools can be used. From early user research, information architecture, interaction design, prototyping, usability testing and visual design to an overall design thinking development process and more. But it is also a matter of iterations and optimal collaboration with other disciplines.
