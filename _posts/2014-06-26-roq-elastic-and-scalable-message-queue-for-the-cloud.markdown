RoQ is the first implementation of EQS(Elastic Queue Service), a new architecture designed Message-oriented middleware for efficient messaging in the cloud.

Traditionally, Message-oriented middlewares are not designed to support elastic scaling. This means that in a cloud context, they may very quickly become a bottleneck in terms of performance.

RoQ has been designed to answer this problem elasticity and scalability. This includes three properties:<br/>
- When required, the capacity of the system will be increased automatically<br/>
- This capacity increase has no impact on the global performance<br/>
- When the load decreases, the system will scale down to avoid using unnecessary resources

RoQ started as a research project within EURA NOVA and has since then evolved into an open-source project.
