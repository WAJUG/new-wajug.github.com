Have you always wanted to __add predictive capabilities or conversational interfaces to your application__, but haven’t been able to find the time or the right technology to get started? 

Everybody wants to build smart apps, but only a few are Data Scientists.<br/>
This session will help you understand machine learning terminology & challenges. 

_We’ll use Amazon AI services to build conversational interfaces to your applications using voice and text; add image analysis to your applications; turn text into lifelike speech that you can store and play back; and build smart machine learning applications quickly and easily._ 

We’ll explore Apache MXNet, an open source, state of the art deep learning engine, which allows developers to build sophisticated, custom artificial intelligence systems. With MXNet developers have access to a fully-featured, flexibly-programmable and ultra-scalable deep learning framework supporting state-of-the-art deep models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). 

Demo foreseen.<br/>
_This session will be in english._
